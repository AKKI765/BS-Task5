      <h3>Responsive Grid System</h3>
      <p>One of the key features of Bootstrap is its responsive grid system. 
        It is based on a 12-column layout, which allows developers to create flexible 
        and responsive web designs. The grid system is divided into various breakpoints
         (e.g., extra small, small, medium, large), and developers can specify how the 
         layout should behave at different screen sizes. This enables the website to adapt
          and look good on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.</p>

      <h3>Pre-styled Components</h3>
      <p>Bootstrap provides a wide range of pre-styled components that can be easily incorporated into a web application.
         These components include buttons, forms, navigation bars, dropdowns, modals, carousels, and much more. By using 
         these components, developers can save time and effort in designing and implementing common UI elements. 
         Bootstrap also offers customizable themes and styles, allowing developers to customize the look and feel of their websites.</p>

      <h3>JavaScript Plugins</h3>        
      <p>Bootstrap comes bundled with a set of JavaScript plugins that enhance the functionality of the components.
         These plugins provide interactive features such as image sliders, dropdown menus, tooltips, modals, and scrollspy. 
         Developers can utilize these plugins by adding the necessary JavaScript code and HTML attributes to their web pages.
          The plugins are well-documented and can be easily customized to meet specific requirements.</p>
